# pictouresque-application
An mobile application that uses image recognition and gps location to provide users with an informative audio tour experience. As a group of avid travelers, we wanted an easier way to receive information at our fingertips about our surroundings! Hence, the birth of Pictouresque.

## What it does:
The app allows users to take pictures of their surroundings and get an informative audio tour (featuring bites of information about what's in the picture).

## How we built it: 
The app was built using Java and Android-Studio. Instead of making our own camera within the app itself, we used an existing API to scan instead of take a picture, and then compare that scan to a library of buildings.

## What's next for Pictouresque:
We hope to grow the user-base so that users can generate information for attractions they visit. Our aim is to allow other users to vote for their favorite bites, and the most popular bites will be generated for users seeking information about that specific attraction. We also hope to create a feature that points users to nearby attractions, and connect to social media accounts to share about their experiences.
